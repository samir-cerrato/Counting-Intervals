2 Task 2: Counting intervals

2.1 Problem description

In this task, your input includes a list of n intervals [x, y) where x is the starting point and y is the
ending point. Given a list of n query points, for each query q, you need to report the number of intervals
containing q. In other words, you will return the number of intervals [x, y) such that x â‰¤q < y. To
simplify the task, there are no duplicates of starting and ending points among all n intervals. The
values x, y, q are floats with maximum 4 decimal places.
Your input will start with the value of n, continuing with n intervals, and n queries. For each interval,
float coordinates x and y are separated by one space.
For each query q, you should output an integer (from 0 to n) that counts the number of intervals
containing q. Given an array counter for n queries, a Python script to output should be:

for x in counter:

print(x)
